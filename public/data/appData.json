    "mainContent": "Hello! I am Raza, a front-end web developer, and I live in Iran. It has been 6 years since I started learning programming, and during this time I worked in person for some time and as a project for a while, which made me familiar with javascript and python languages. As I worked and my interest in automating repetitive tasks made me curious about some libraries. Finally, I found my penchant in creating a website to bring up pages for others to enjoy while working, and now I am eager to do so, and raise up the ideas in your head to the monitor screen. In addition, I am also interested in Backend and hope to be able to pursue this field more professionally in the future."
